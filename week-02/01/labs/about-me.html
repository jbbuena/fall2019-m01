        My name is Juan Buena and I'm a senior at Syracuse Univesrity. I am 23 years old and I am majoring in 
        Information Management & Technology at the iSchool. I am concentrating in Data Analytics, but I am taking 
        courses on front end development out of interest. So far I have taken about four programming courses, one in Python,
        one in Java, one in R, and one in Haskell. 
    </p>

        I am from Los Angeles, CA. I am a big sports fan and support most of the LA teams. In my spare time I enjoy going to
        games and cooking. I am hoping to go back to California after graduation and possibly get a position working in data analytics or 
        front end web development.
