                then Mexican territory until 1847 where it found its way into the U.S. with the conlusion of the Mexican-American war. 
                By the beginning of the 20th Century, L.A. had become home to burgeoning movie industry. In the early 20's, the world's film industry had 
                nearly all been based out os Hollywood. With a booming economy following the end of World War II, Los Angeles' rise has continued well into the present 
                with a vibrant travel economy, flourishing tech industry, and of course, media and entertainment opportunities for every individual looking to chase their
                dreams in the city of Angels. Learn more about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Los_Angeles#Racially_Restrictive_Housing_Covenants">L.A.'s history here.</a>
