                    <h2>Mexican Food</h2>
                    <p>
                        It's no secret that Los Angeles, and California in general, has a large hispanic population. This has resulted in Southern California becoming
                        home to the best Mexican food in the country (sorry Texas, its true). L.A. is home to straight up authentic spots and newer, more modern takes
                        on classic recipes. Whatever you're looking for there's sure to be something you definitely come back for the next day (or meal).
                        To be completely honest, you could go to any random Mexican restaurant in L.A. and get better, more authentic dishes than 90% of the country
                        so you really can't go wrong here.

                    <h2>Asian Cuisines</h2>
                    <p>
                        With nearly 2 million Asian Americans living in Los Angeles, the city boasts some of the best Asian cuisine in the world. Whether you're here for
                        some fusion dishes or traditional meals, the sheer variety you have your fingertips is astonishing. If you only had 7 days in L.A. you could make
                        your whole trip a mission to try cuisine from all over Asia in just that week. Japanes, Thai, Filipino, Chinese, Vietnamese, Indian, Burmese,
                        you name it and L.A.'s got it!

                                Much like Mexican cuisine, there's a good chance that going to any random Asian restaurant you happen upon in this city will give you 
                                a more delicious, authentic experience when compared to the rest of the U.S.

                    <h2>Seafood</h2>
                    <p>
                        While we don't have the reputation for seafood that the east coast has (we make up for that by having the best sushi in the country, it's a fact),
                        we still have a couple of decent options to for you to check out. We are a coastal city, but that doesn't mean you need to make your way to the
                        beach to get a taste of some good grub (and frankly, no one has the time).

                    <h2>Iconic Restaraunts</h2>
                    <p>
                        It's not a Hollywood tourist site if I didn't include classic restaurants that have either been featured in movies, become local legend, or 
                        gained heavy social media following in the past decade. Regardless of whatever your definition of iconic is, these restaurants are surely good for
                        some photo ops and great food.
