                        <h2>The Westside</h2>
                        <p>
                            If you  want to be right in the middle of all the action in current day Los Angeles, the West Side is where you want to stay. 
                            From iconic Beverly Hills to picturesque Venice Beach, the West L.A. has the most to offer in such a condensed space. Conveniently located
                            near LAX, you can pack a week's worth of activities in West L.A. alone, provided you love the nightlife and are food addict. If you plan it right,
                            you might be able to avoid all the traffic of Los Angeles since so much is packed so close (disclaimer: does not apply to getting to and from LAX).
                        </p>

                        <h2>North Hollywood & The San Fernando Valley</h2>
                        <p>
                            If you need a more economical option, with kids, or not too enamored with the bright nightlife, staying in the Valley is a good option for 
                            having easy access to L.A. without paying an astronomical price to enjoy your vacation. With access to all major freeways, going to down to the
                            city can be a headache free affair as long as you time it right. If you like the outdoors taying in the Valley will give you an easier 
                            time getting to parks and outdoor activities. If you're bringing your family, you can take the 5 up to Magic Mountain and have a day at an 
                            amusement park. Regardless of whether you're staying in the valley for the outdoor ops, you're bringing a family, or just need a more economic
                            option, the Valley can give you the full L.A. experience without breaking the bank.

                        <h2>East L.A. & The San Gabriel Valley</h2>
                        <p>
                            The East Side of Los Angeles is one of the oldest portions of L.A. that has not really been too altered by something like the technological boom
                            like the West Side has nor is it filled with the nightlfie. For the most part, East L.A. is fairly quiet. And that's what makes it so comforting 
                            (granted, I am from East L.A. so here's a bias disclaimer), East L.A. is about as unaltered as you can get from the rest of L.A. It's culture is 
                            still very strong in the fabric of the towns that comprise it. There's kind of a ruggedness about the East Side, from Boyle Heights to West Covina,
                            the culture that makes up L.A. (not the culture brought by transplants) was born and bread there. It's more of a place to raise a family than go out
                            and party, but what it lacks in nightlife it makes up for in cuisine. The variety and diversity we have over here is all thanks to the different 
                            people that decided to call East L.A. home in Los Angeles' early years. From Armenian to Thai, you're sure to find a dish that you'll remember for
                            the rest of your life.

                        <h2>Surrounding Areas</h2>
                        <p>
                            Of course, there's more to Southern California than just Los Angeles (even if it's the most important), there are a plethora of options in the 
                            immediate surrounding areas for you to consider (and probably far cheaper to boot). If you want a bit of a happy medium between Los Angeles and
                            San Diego, staying in Huntington Beach or Irvine is a solid option. They're located in Orange County so, not L.A., but close enough access that you
                            can plan out a vacation where you visit L.A., Anaheim, and San Diego. This is a pretty good option if you have a good amount of time to spend in 
                            Southern California or are really committed to a schedule. If you choose to stay in Irvine, that also gives you quicker access to Disney Land so 
                            that's something to think about when making a decision.With multiple parks, beaches, and cities decent proximity (I will never say close by
                            because you could definitely be stuck on the road for over an hour), staying in one of the surrounding areas is a good option.
