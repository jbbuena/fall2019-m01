    <p><h1>Project Proposal: Visiting Los Angeles</h1></p>
    <p> 
        My idea for the final project is a guide website for people interested in visiting Los Angeles. 
        I can probably get most of the images I need from either the internet or from my own phone because I live there, 
        Iâ€™ll just have to site the sources for the images from the internet. My current thoughts for the site is for it to have 
        4 main pages with subpages inside. 
    </p>
    <p>
         <strong>Pages:</strong><br>
        Where to stay<br>
        Things to do<br>
        Food & Drink<br>
        About L.A.
