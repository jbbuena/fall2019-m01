    <p> <h1>About Me</h1> </p>
    <strong>Who am I? What do I do?</strong>
    <p>
        My name is Juan Buena and I'm a senior at <em>Syracuse University</em>. I am 23 years old and I am majoring in 
        Information Management & Technology at the <abbr title= "School of Information">iSchool</abbr>. I am concentrating in 
        <u>Data Analytics</u>, but I am taking courses on front end development out of interest. So far I have taken about four 
        programming courses, one in Python, one in Java, one in R, and one in Haskell. 
    </p>
    <p>
        I am from Los Angeles, CA. I am a big sports fan and support most of the LA teams. In my spare time 
        I enjoy going to games and cooking. I am hoping to go back to California after graduation and possibly get a position working 
        in data analytics or front end web development.
